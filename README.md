# Graph Visualizer Using Java

This project is used to visualize graph based algorithms, and is developed using Core Java and JavaFx.
## Algorithms

- Graph Traversal using **BFS**
- Graph Traversal using **DFS**
- Shortest Path using **Dijkstra**
- **Components** Using DFS
- **Spanning Tree** from Graph
- **Articulation Points** in Graph
- **Bridges** in Graph
## Features

- Create **Graph** and **Edges** with just a simple **Click**
- Actual **Matrix Representation** of the Graph at the Right Side of the Window
- Easy to use and Responsive
- **Modularized Code**
- Animation using **Threads**
- Animation **Speed** Control
- **Clear** Animation and **Reset** Graph
